    <p>"Supreme is the undisputed king of cool of modern day streetwear.
    The brand is in a class of its own, being one of the first names in skate</p>
    <p>wear to actually cross cultural borders between hip-hop, art, high-fashion,
    pop and more. Never has a brand so polarizing now too, with devoted fans</p>
    <p>still praising its subversively cool aesthetic and haters bashing the brand
    fueling the negative ideologies of 'hype.' But whether you get it or not,
    <p>the results has been of course, met with ravenous acceptance as hordes of
    streetwear fans are still willing to pay top dollar for its logo-adorned
    goods."</p>
