    <p>"Supreme is the undisputed king of cool of modern day streetwear. The brand is in a class of its own, being one of the first names in skate wear to actually cross cultural borders between hip-hop, art, high-fashion, pop and more. Never has a brand
      so polarizing now too, with devoted fans still praising its subversively cool aesthetic and haters bashing the brand fueling the negative ideologies of 'hype.' But whether you get it or not, the results has been of course, met with ravenous acceptance
      as hordes of streetwear fans are still willing to pay top dollar for its logo-adorned goods."</p>
