  <h4>THE START OF SUPREME</h4>
  <h2>The brand is in a class of its own, being one of the first names in skate
    wear to actually cross cultural borders between hip-hop, art, high-fashion,
    pop and more. Never has been a brand so polarizing now too, with devoted fans
    still praising its subversively cool aesthetic and haters bashing the brand
    for fueling the negative ideologies of ‘hype.’</h2>

<div class="s_overlay_text_2">
  <h2>But whether you get it or not, founder James Jebbia has carefully curated Supreme’s
    street-meets-art culture ethos for those in the know. The result has been of
    course, met with ravenous acceptance as hordes of streetwear fans are still
    willing to pay top dollar — even at a sometimes 2000% mark-up in re-sellers
    market — for its logo-adorned goods.</h2>

  <h2>Originally a skate shop, “Supreme wasn’t meant to be a brand. I just was
      like, ‘Hey, that’s a cool name for a store.’ Founder James Jebbia went on to say, “With Supreme,
      there were no grand plans—with the name, with the store, with anything. It all just evolved.

  <h2>“A lot of us who didn’t have apartments, who had weird situations,
      we all knew we could go there, get a meal, have a beer, a smoke,” said Mr. Bondaroff,
      the gallerist, who was a high-school dropout from Brooklyn at the time.</h2>
