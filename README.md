# GRC 338 Final Project

## Overview
For the final project, you will be creating a basic, functional website. The site should be based on a single, cohesive theme and must follow these guidelines:

- The site has at least 4 html pages (including the main `index.html`)
- There is a navigation system that is consistent throughout the site. It must be user-friendly and syntactically semantic (ie. use the `nav` tag)
- All styling must be done in a linked, external CSS file. No inline or embedded CSS is allowed.
- There should be a healthy amount of copy text, images, and graphics.
- All work must be original. Any evidence of plagiarism will result in a 0 on the project and a report sent to the [Office of Student Rights & Responsibilities](http://www.osrr.calpoly.edu/plagiarism). (The only exception to this is if you decide to re-design an existing website.)
- All work that isn't yours should be properly cited. Please give credit to photo authors and sources of used code.
- The website **cannot be**:
    - a portfolio
    - a slideshow (if you plan on showcasing many images, please provide captions and copy to accompany the images)
- All html pages should be valid `HTML5`
    - Use the [online validator](https://validator.w3.org) to test each of your html pages.
- The site does not necessary have to be responsive. I prefer to see an awesome unresponsive site than a half-baked responsive one. If you decide to add responsiveness, only design for at most two media break points.

## Timeline
### Week 7
Begin working on the project. Determine what your website will be about. Before you continue with any part of the project, you must present your idea to the instructor for approval. Once you have approval, you can then start working on wire-framing your site and collecting assets. If you plan on re-designing a website, collect screenshots of the original website.

#### Deliverables
You should complete at least 4 commits in your project git repository. These commits may not include a lot of code, but they should show evidence of your working on the project (ie images in the image file, digital wire-frames, etc.).

These commits must be pushed to this repository to receive credit for lab this week.

### Week 8
Continue working on your website. If you decide to change the topic of your website, you must present the new idea to the instructor for approval at the beginning of lab, otherwise you will be expected to turn in the website you proposed the week before. No changing topics after week 8.

#### Deliverables
Complete at least 4 commits during lab. By the end of lab, you should be roughly 50% done with the website.

Commits must be pushed to this repository to receive credit for the lab.

### Week 9
Continue work on the website. At this point you may choose to add some bells and whistles to your site via JavaScript. Be careful to not let "scope creep" derail your ability to finish on time.

#### Deliverables
Complete at least 4 commits during lab.

Commits must be pushed to this repository to receive credit for the lab.

### Week 10
Finish the project. The project is due at the end of lab this week. Be sure that you have a working website that has valid HTML5 pages.

#### Deliverables
Complete at least 4 commits during lab. Also be sure that your final commits include your original wireframes and reference screenshots if you chose to redesign an existing site.

Commits must be pushed to this repository to receive credit for the lab and for the project. The project will be graded by reviewing the latest commit before the deadline. You can continue adding to the remote repository, but only the content timestamped before the deadline will be considered for a grade.
