    <h4>JEFF STAPLE (Staple):</h4>
    <h6>Independently created stuff. It wasn't streetwear yet. It was just people
      hustling, doing their own thing without any business or financial gain.
      Just expression.</h6>
  </div>

  <div id="box2">
    <h4>JERRY LORENZO (Fear of God):</h4>
    <h6>I guess anything would be considered street that comes outside of the
      traditional fashion system… and I still don’t really know what exactly
      ‘that system’ is.</h6>
  </div>

  <div id="box3">
    <h4>EDISON CHEN (CLOT):</h4>
    <h6>Streetwear is about culture. It’s not about clothing. It’s about stories.
      It's a lifestyle.
      It's how we feel. It's how we live. It's what we listen to. It's what we eat.
      It's how we spend our money.
